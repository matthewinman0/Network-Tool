# Network Tool

Network Tool is a simple Material 3 based ping application built in Kotlin for Android.

This is my first real Android project and my first proper use of GitHub for managing and sharing a project.

The app allows you to:

- Ping any hostname or IP address  
- Check whether a host is reachable
